# PACS

The system of preliminary analysis of the cluster structure

Due to lack of the time the development is carried out with the following restrictions:  

  -comment "# lack_of_the_time" means that the following code is quick'n'dirty temporary solution
  -system can not be deployed anywhere other than my computer  
  -system will be tested only on two datasets from [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans) and [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-dbscan-py)
  -a minimal set of features will be implemented  
  -everything will be implemented in the most simple(not optimal) way (for example, fetching data from database, any calculations and visualizations)
