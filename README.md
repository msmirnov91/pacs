# PACS

The system of preliminary analysis of the cluster structure

Due to lack of the time the development is carried out with the following restrictions:

-comment "# lack of the time" means that the following code is quick'n'dirty temporary solution
-system can not be deployed anywhere other than my computer
-system will be tested only on two datasets: "Storage/Raw/dbscan_data.csv" and "Storage/Raw/kmeans_data.csv"
-a minimal set of features will be implemented
-everything will be implemented in the most simple(not optimal) way (for example, fetching data from database, any calculations and visualizations)
